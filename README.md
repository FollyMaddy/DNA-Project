#DNA_PCR_microbit_test_V18

The actual first test programmed in blocks for microbit

pictures of program added

An ELCO was used over a 100k thermistor with a 100k in series

We want to use part this "layout" to be used in the arduino program


#pcr-arduinoMegaR3-2

first program to make thermisors working and to calibrate 100k an 10k thermistors

100k values seem to be ok

10k values have to be checked

we want to add ELCO's over the thermistor for accurancy an calibrate again
