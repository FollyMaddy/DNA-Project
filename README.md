# DNA_PCR_microbit_test_V18

First attempt to make test program in blocks for microbit.

Pictures of program added.

An ELCO was used over a 100k thermistor with a 100k in series.

We want to use part this "layout" to be used in the arduino program.


# pcr-arduinoMegaR3-2

Program to make thermisors working and to calibrate 100k an 10k thermistors.

100k values seem to be ok.

10k values have to be checked.

We want to add ELCO's over the thermistor for accurancy an calibrate again.
