# DNA_PCR_microbit_test_V18

First attempt to make a test program in blocks for microbit.

Pictures of the program are added.

An ELCO was used over a 100k thermistor with a 100k in series.

A mosfet is switched to turn on or off a heater element.

We want to use part this structure to be used in the arduino program.


# pcr-arduinoMegaR3-2

Program to make thermisors working and to calibrate a 100k and a 10k thermistor.

100k measured values seem to be ok.

10k measured values have to be checked.

We want to add ELCO's over the thermistor for accurancy and calibrate thermistors again.
